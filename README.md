Smart Agri Rover – AI-Based Autonomous Agricultural Monitoring System

Smart Agri Rover is an intelligent, autonomous agricultural robot designed to assist farmers in monitoring crop health, detecting weeds and diseases, and analyzing field conditions in real time. The system combines robotics, computer vision, IoT, and Artificial Intelligence to automate agricultural inspection tasks and reduce manual labor.

The rover moves across the field using belt wheels for stable navigation on uneven terrain and is equipped with a camera and sensors to capture live images and environmental data. Using deep learning models such as YOLO and ResNet-based hybrid networks, the system detects weeds, identifies plant diseases, and differentiates crops from unwanted plants with high accuracy. This enables farmers to take timely action and improve productivity.

A Raspberry Pi acts as the main processing unit, collecting data from cameras and sensors, running AI models locally, and sending results to a web dashboard through wireless communication. The web interface displays real-time monitoring, detection results, and field analytics, allowing users to remotely control and supervise the rover.

Additional sensors like temperature and humidity modules help analyze environmental conditions that affect crop growth. The system also supports mapping and area coverage to ensure complete field inspection.

Smart Agri Rover provides a cost-effective and smart farming solution by combining automation, AI-based detection, and remote monitoring. It helps reduce pesticide usage, saves time, lowers labor costs, and increases crop yield through precise and data-driven farming techniques.

Overall, the project demonstrates the practical integration of embedded systems, machine learning, and web technologies to build an efficient and scalable smart agriculture system.
